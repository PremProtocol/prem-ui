# Project Title & Description

Prem is a prediction market on The Open Network (TON), addressing the need for a decentralized, transparent platform for betting on future events.

Users can create markets, place bets, and claim winnings through TON's smart contracts. The app also caches data for performance. Future updates will bring a new UI, Telegram theme support, and NFT badges for active users.

## Problem Statement

Traditional prediction markets often lack transparency and are hard to use. Prem solves this by leveraging TON's blockchain for transparent transactions and offering a user-friendly Telegram mini-app.
